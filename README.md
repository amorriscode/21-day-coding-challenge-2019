# 21-Day Coding Challenge by Lighthouse Labs

This repo is a storage place for the code developed during the [2019 21-day codng challnge hosted by Lighthouse Labs](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/).

The challenge serves as a tool to ensure I write a little bit of code everyday. On top of that, I've gathered some friends and family and will encourage them to learn to code. Doing it alongside them will allow me to provide better help if they need it (also, I could win prizes üèÜ).

If you're reading this and the challenge isn't over then you can [join my team](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/teams/join/bits-and-bytes). The code to join is `UMBRELLA`.

Good luck!

__Note: Some of the code style is not my own as I have copied from Lighthouse Labs üòÖ...__
